# DesktopFamiliar
Desktop pet program inspired by that one goose

## Summary
This project was made by starting out with the guide found here: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/create-your-own-desktop-pet-with-python-5b369be18868. The goal is to add new features and switch out animation assets overtime so it grows into it's own application. My intention is for this to be a project that has no true end and gains more and more features overtime.

## Current Features
* Desktop Familiar moves around the screen
* Events are cycled through correctly

## Planned Features/Updates
* <s>Desktop Familiar has new animations</s> (Completed 11/15!)
* <s>Desktop Familiar can move up and down</s> (Completed 12/19!)
* <s>Users can name their Desktop Familiar</s> (Completed 1/19!)
* Desktop Familiar gets more events than just walking around and sleeping
* Users can choose their species of Desktop Familiar
